### Methodology
The methodology used in this project is the Kanban Agile management methodology.

It was put in place using different functionalities in GitHub: 
* Issues, for the user stories; <!-- add pic -->
* Milestone (without due date), for the product backlog; <!-- add pic -->
* Milestone (WITH due date), for each iteration; <!-- add pic -->
* Project, for the Kanban board. I created a project per iteration. <!-- add pic -->
> Kanban is an Agile management method built on a philosophy of continuous improvement, where work items are ‚Äúpulled‚Äù from a product backlog into a steady flow of work. The framework is applied using Kanban boards‚Äîa form of visual project management. In a Kanban board, tasks‚Äîrepresented as cards‚Äîmove through stages of work‚Äîrepresented as columns...‚ÄúTo do,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn progress,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDone.‚Äù Each column is filled with visual cards that represent individual tasks. A team moves through the columns until the tasks are completed.

#### Typography
A combination of two fonts were used in the desing of the application:<br> 
* "Homemade Apple",in the logo and headings;<br>
* "Raleway",in the body and footer.<br>

This pairing of fonts provides a touch of elegance and clearness to read the rest of the content.

#### Colors
The selected color palette for in the application comes from a color generator.<br>
This combination in the background colors and fonts adds freshness and respect the minimum contrast values for good accesibility.

    -   database url
    -   cloudinary url
    -   port
    -   disable collectstatic
