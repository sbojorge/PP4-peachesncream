# Peaches 'n cream


This is a grocery shopping list application that, as its [meaning](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/peaches-and-cream) in informal english states, is expected to be pleasant and easy.<br>
It'll be useful for users searching to organize their trips for groceries.
The application lets the user create, read, update and/or delete grocery shopping lists. <br>
List won't be lost nor forgotten, but instead will be right at user's finger tips in his/her mobile.<br>
<br>

### Methodology
The methodology used in this project is the Kanban Agile management methodology.

It was put in place using different functionalities in GitHub: 
* Issues, for the user stories; <!-- add pic -->
* Milestone (without due date), for the product backlog; <!-- add pic -->
* Milestone (WITH due date), for each iteration; <!-- add pic -->
* Project, for the Kanban board. I created a project per iteration. <!-- add pic -->
> Kanban is an Agile management method built on a philosophy of continuous improvement, where work items are ‚Äúpulled‚Äù from a product backlog into a steady flow of work. The framework is applied using Kanban boards‚Äîa form of visual project management. In a Kanban board, tasks‚Äîrepresented as cards‚Äîmove through stages of work‚Äîrepresented as columns...‚ÄúTo do,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn progress,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDone.‚Äù Each column is filled with visual cards that represent individual tasks. A team moves through the columns until the tasks are completed.
